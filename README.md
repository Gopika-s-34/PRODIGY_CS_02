#Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation

**Overview**

As part of my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed an image encryption tool utilizing pixel manipulation techniques. This approach focuses on altering the pixel values of an image to securely encode its content, making it accessible only to those with the decryption key.

**Key Features**

**Pixel-Based Encryption:** 
The tool manipulates pixel values through operations such as swapping or basic arithmetic to transform the original image into an encrypted form. This method modifies the image data to conceal its visual content.

**Encryption and Decryption:** 
Users can encrypt an image by applying specific pixel manipulation techniques and decrypt it using the same or corresponding operations, thus restoring the original image.

**Detailed Explanation**

**Encryption Process:**
The encryption process involves manipulating the pixel values of the image. This may include swapping pixel values or applying arithmetic operations to each pixel, effectively scrambling the image data and making it unreadable without decryption.

**Decryption Process:**
To recover the original image, the decryption process reverses the encryption operations. This involves applying the inverse of the pixel manipulations used during encryption to restore the original pixel values and, consequently, the original image.

**Pixel Manipulation Techniques:**
The tool leverages various pixel manipulation techniques to achieve encryption. These may include swapping pixel values to change their positions or performing arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction to alter pixel values systematically.

**Educational Value:**
Implementing pixel manipulation for image encryption provides practical insights into fundamental cryptographic techniques applied to visual data. It helps in understanding how basic operations can be used to secure digital images and offers a foundation for exploring more sophisticated encryption methods.

**Practical Applications:**
While pixel manipulation techniques offer a basic level of encryption, they are useful for educational purposes and understanding the principles of image data security. These methods provide a starting point for learning about more advanced image encryption algorithms used in real-world applications.
